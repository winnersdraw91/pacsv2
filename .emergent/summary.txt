<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully built a multi-tenant PACS system MVP using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, as per the user's initial request. The trajectory shows a systematic build process, starting with backend and frontend scaffolding, then incrementally adding core functionalities like user management, DICOM study handling, and an advanced DICOM viewer. Key achievements include implementing multi-role dashboards, a fully-featured DICOM viewer with 2D/3D, MPR, MIP, and various manipulation tools, and initial setup for search and report editing. The engineer addressed several bugs, including a  issue and a frontend  component error. The process involved multiple iterations of building, testing, and refining based on user feedback, notably expanding the DICOM viewer's capabilities significantly. The work culminated with a commitment to implement remaining features, including billing and technician file management, and a comprehensive validation using a testing agent.

The goal is to build a self-hosted, scalable, multi-tenant PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) for diagnostic centers, radiologists, and technicians. Key features include advanced DICOM management (upload, storage, metadata), a custom DICOM viewer with AI-based study tools (zoom, pan, MPR, MIP, 3D volume rendering, measurements, annotations, contrast), automated AI-generated medical reporting (mock functionality initially), comprehensive billing and admin controls, and multi-tenant architecture with role-based user portals (Admin, Diagnostic Center, Technician, Radiologist). The system also requires JWT-based authentication, object storage for DICOMs, and an audit trail. The current build has established the core FastAPI backend with user authentication and CRUD operations, a React frontend with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, multi-role dashboards (Admin, Centre, Technician, Radiologist), and a highly functional DICOM viewer supporting various viewing modes and tools. Initial search, draft, and delete request functionalities for studies have been integrated into the backend.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python backend for API development.
- **React**: Frontend library for UI.
- **MongoDB**: Database for data storage, using GridFS for DICOMs.
- **Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS**: Frontend styling and component library.
- **VTK.js & Cornerstone.js**: Libraries for DICOM rendering in the viewer.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization for FastAPI.
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication for securing API endpoints.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Architecture supporting separate data for each diagnostic center.
- **DICOM**: Standard for medical imaging, including file management and viewing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: The main FastAPI application. It handles user authentication (Admin, Centre, Radiologist, Technician), CRUD operations for studies, users, and reports, and integrates with MongoDB for data persistence, including GridFS for DICOM storage. Recent changes include:
    -   Implementation of multi-role authentication and authorization.
    -   Endpoints for managing diagnostic centers, radiologists, technicians, and studies.
    -   Initial support for search queries on studies.
    -   Addition of  and  fields for study management.
    -   API for report editing with timestamped audit trails.
    -   Integration for demo data generation.
    -   Error handling for bcrypt password hashing.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component, responsible for defining the application's routes and overall layout. It manages authentication state and renders different dashboards based on user roles. It was rewritten to set up the primary routing and layout structure.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Global CSS styles, primarily leveraging Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and custom gradients for visual themes across different portals.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Admin/AdminDashboard.jsx**: Provides the interface for super-admin functionalities, including managing diagnostic centers and radiologists.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Centre/CentreDashboard.jsx**: Interface for diagnostic center managers, enabling them to oversee their center's data and personnel.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Radiologist/RadiologistDashboard.jsx**: Displays assigned and unassigned studies for radiologists, with integration for the DICOM viewer and report editing. Recently updated to include advanced search and filter options.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Technician/TechnicianDashboard.jsx**: Portal for technicians to upload DICOM files, enter patient demographics, and view upload history.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Report/ReportDialog.jsx**: A modal component used by radiologists to view and edit AI-generated or final reports, now including a feature for viewing edit history.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Search/AdvancedSearch.jsx**: A newly created reusable component intended for search and filter functionality across various portals. It has been integrated into the Radiologist portal.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Viewer/DicomViewer.jsx**: The core DICOM viewer component. It has undergone extensive enhancements:
    -   Initial implementation for 2D viewing, zoom, pan, rotate, and window/level adjustments.
    -   Advanced features added: MPR (Multi-Planar Reconstruction), 3D Volume Rendering, and MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection).
    -   Comprehensive set of tools integrated: Pan, Zoom, Window/Level, Stack Scroll, Length, Angle, Rectangle ROI, Elliptical ROI, Annotation.
    -   Multi-view layout options (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 1x3, 3x2).
    -   Tooltips added to all viewer tools on hover for better UX.
-   **/app/DEMO_CREDENTIALS.md**: A file generated to store demo login credentials for different user roles.
-   **/.env files (backend and frontend)**: Contain environment variables like , , and . The  was recently added/verified.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Volume measurements (3D ROI)**: Add tool for calculating volume.
-   **MINIP (Minimum Intensity Projection)**: Implement MINIP view mode for air/bone visualization.
-   **Advanced Image Comparison**: Implement synchronized scrolling, study overlay, automatic alignment, and longitudinal tracking.
-   **Remote Collaboration Tools**: Add real-time collaboration features like screen sharing and video conferencing.
-   **Technician File Viewing and Deletion Request**: Implement viewing uploaded DICOMs, requesting deletion, marking as draft, and an approval workflow.
-   **Advanced Search with Filters in all portals**: Integrate the  component with full functionality across all user portals.
-   **Billing functionality in Admin Portal**: Implement billing configuration, invoice generation, and a billing dashboard.
-   **DICOM viewer tool alignment**: Ensure all tools in the navbar are correctly aligned with labels on hover.
-   **DICOM image background**: Change the DICOM image background to black.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing several outstanding features. The user reiterated the need for features like Volume measurements, MINIP, advanced image comparison, remote collaboration tools, technician file viewing/deletion, and advanced search with filters across all portals. Crucially, the user also pointed out that the billing part is missing in admin portal. The AI engineer acknowledged these and stated the intent to implement all the missing features comprehensively! Let me add billing to admin portal and complete all DICOM viewer tools with proper functionality. The user's last request was to validate all function, features and buttons are working in the application, to which the AI engineer responded by preparing to use the  for a comprehensive validation. The current state is that many core features are implemented, especially the advanced DICOM viewer, but the billing module, certain advanced viewer modes/tools, comparison features, collaboration, and full technician file management are pending implementation and subsequent validation.
